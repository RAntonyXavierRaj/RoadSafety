********************************

1. Please run only specific parts of the code based on 
requirement.Because the Accidents.py file has the code 
for all types of classification models and optimisation 
techniques, I have used.

2. Accidents-Logistic.py has the code for Logistic 
regression only.

3. I have made this current folder as the root directory.

4. Slides are in the slides folder. 

5. Inferences folder has the plots of results of various 
models. 

RF -denotes Random Forest
kNN -denotes k-Nearest Neighbour
NB -denotes NaiveBayes
PCA -denotes Principal Component Analysis.

6. Datasets folder must contain the Datasets used. Please
add the datasets in this folder in the following names.

Accidents_2014.csv
Accidents_2015.csv
Accidents_2016.csv
Vehicles_2014.csv
Vehicles_2015.csv
Vehicles_2016.csv
